     <li>30g dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in hot water for 15 mins, then drained (reserve the liquid)</li>
     <li>2 large leeks, chopped</li>
     <li>2 small onions, chopped</li>
     <li>4 medium carrots (about 300g), cut into small cubes</li>
     <li>1 vegetable stock cube (make sure it's vegan)</li>
     <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
     <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
     <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
     <li>1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into small cubes</li>
     <li>½ small pack marjoram or oregano, leaves picked and roughly chopped</li>
     <li>½ small pack thyme, leaves picked</li>
     <li>½ small pack sage, leaves picked and roughly chopped</li>
     <li>4 celery sticks, chopped</li>
     <li>400g can chickpeas</li>
     <li>300g frozen peas</li>
     <li>300g frozen spinach</li>
     <li>20ml olive oil</li>
     <li>small pack flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Put the unpeeled potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with water, bring to the boil and simmer for 40 mins until the skins start to split. Drain and leave to cool a little.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based sauté pan or flameproof casserole dish. Add the mushrooms, leeks , onions, carrots and the stock cube and cook gently for 5 mins , stirring every so often. If it starts to stick, reduce the heat and stir more frequently, scraping the bits from the bottom. The veg should be soft but not mushy.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic, tomato purée, paprika, squash and herbs. Stir and turn the heat up a bit, cook for 3 mins, add the celery, then stir and cook for a few more mins.</li>
    <li>Tip in the chickpeas along with the water in the can and reserved mushroom stock. Add the peas and spinach and stir well. Cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, then season, turn off and set aside. There should still be plenty of liquid and the veg should be bright and a little firm.</li>
    <li>Peel the potatoes and discard the skin. Mash 200g with a fork and stir into the veg. Break the rest of the potatoes into chunks, mix with the olive oil and parsley and season.</li>
    <li>Divide the filling into the pie dishes and top with the potatotes. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and bake the pies for 40-45 mins, until the top is golden and the filling is heated through. If making individual pies, check after 20 mins. Best served with tomato ketchup – as all great shepherd’s pies are.</li>
