    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Enjoy our vegan version of scones, which uses soy milk and vegan vegetable spread to replace the dairy. Serve with vegan cream and your favourite jam</p>
    <p>Serves 6 - Total cooking and prep time 40 minutes</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>350g self-raising flour, extra for dusting</li>
     <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
     <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
     <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
     <li>95g vegan vegetable spread</li>
     <li>150ml soy milk, plus extra to glaze</li>
     <li>Jam</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar in a bowl. Rub in the vegetable spread until you have fine breadcrumbs. You can also gradually pulse it in a food processor until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually stir the milk into the flour mixture until you have a smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust your surface with flour and gently roll out the scone dough until 2cm thick. Transfer onto a baking tray lined with parchment and put it in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the fridge and using a 7cm cutter, cut out the scones. Put them, top side down, onto another baking sheet lined with paper, leaving a 2cm gap between each one. This gives the scones an even top. Brush with the extra milk, making sure that it doesnâ€™t drip onto the sides (otherwise they will rise unevenly). Put the scones in the freezer for 15 mins. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Remove from the freezer and bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Serve with jam and vegan cream, if you like.</li>
